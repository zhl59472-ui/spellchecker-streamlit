# 📘 Spelling Counter – Streamlit Version  
Converted from `spelling_counter_modified.ipynb`

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a Streamlit web application converted from my previously submitted Jupyter Notebook:

**`spelling_counter_modified.ipynb`**

The original notebook was designed to:
- Load multiple `.txt` files
- Detect misspelled words using the `pyspellchecker` library
- Count the frequency of each misspelled word
- Export the results as a CSV file

The Streamlit app reproduces the same logic, but provides an interactive webpage for easier use and real-time feedback.
